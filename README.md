<h1 align="center">Gesture Controlled Volume Adjustment ToolðŸ§ª</h1>

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello

This is an interactive tool developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe for adjusting volume through hand gestures. This 
project demonstrates the fusion of computer vision and haptic feedback, enabling intuitive audio control via 
the distance between the thumb and index finger. Highlights innovation in user interface design, offering a 
glimpse into the future of interactive technology.

## Requirments
Requirements using: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
Press 'a' to exit the webcam.

## Contributions
This was a solo hobby project to explore the how OPENCV can be integrated to haptics .  Feel free to fork this repo and make your own contributions!
